## **SECTION 2: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

The AI-powered Scheduling System is a smart personal assistant built to address the failures of traditional, static scheduling tools. Where most calendars fail to adapt to a user's dynamic energy levels, stress, and changing priorities, this project provides a human-centered solution that optimizes for both productivity and well-being.

By analyzing a user's historical data (such as task completion rates, time usage, and self-reported stress/energy levels), the system generates personalized and adaptive schedules designed to reduce decision fatigue and prevent burnout.

**🚀Core Technical Features**

The system's intelligence is driven by a two-part reasoning engine:

**🧠 Task Evaluation Model**: The model that predicts the expected energy, pressure, and completion quality for any given task. It uses historical impact weights to learn from a user's past performance, ensuring its recommendations improve over time.

**📅 Scheduler**: A rule-based reasoning system that transforms the prioritized task list into a feasible and adaptive timetable. It intelligently handles fixed and flexible tasks, using a progressive fitting strategy and priority-based swapping to manage conflicts. A key feature is its ability to optimize the length and placement of rest periods to maximize user energy recovery.

The front-end includes a **weekly timetable**, **daily & weekly report📊**, and an **AI chatbot💬** which leverages an LLM to understand natural language and automatically create tasks, creating a seamless user experience. This project is designed for students and knowledge workers who need to balance complex schedules with a sustainable, healthy routine.
